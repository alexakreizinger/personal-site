During my time as a technical writer, I've written a *lot* of documentation—but don't just take my word for it! Here are some examples of the kinds of docs I've worked on over the years.

## User guides
Everything from step-by-step installation guides to big-picture conceptual explainers. (These are based on real docs that I've published, but all company and product names have been anonymized.)

:memo: [Integration Options](https://samples.alexakreizinger.com/integration-options)
: A product overview that compares the two available integration options for ProductABC.

:memo: [Tag Types & Environments](https://samples.alexakreizinger.com/tag-types)
: A technical reference that compares ProductXYZ's various detection tags and the environments they run in.

:memo: [Closing the Loop](https://samples.alexakreizinger.com/closing-loop)
: A conceptual guide that describes how (and why) to use ProductABC and ProductXYZ together.

:memo: [IVT Taxonomy](https://samples.alexakreizinger.com/ivt)
: A glossary that defines the different categories of invalid traffic (IVT) detected by CompanyName.

:memo: [Clusters](https://samples.alexakreizinger.com/clusters)
: A product overview with information about the server clusters that CompanyName sets up on behalf of each ProductABC user.

:memo: [Set Up Dashboard Alerts](https://samples.alexakreizinger.com/alerts)
: A conceptual guide that describes how to set up email alerts through the CompanyName Dashboard.

:memo: [Create and Adjust Custom Views](https://samples.alexakreizinger.com/views)
: A conceptual guide that describes how to create custom data visualizations in the CompanyName Dashboard.

:memo: [Dashboard SSO](https://samples.alexakreizinger.com/sso)
: An integration walkthrough that explains how to configure Okta single sign-on access for the CompanyName Dashboard.

## API docs
I wish I could share the actual APIs and SDKs I've worked on, but it's hard to do that without divulging sensitive product info... so, for the sake of this sample collection, I opted to design my own mock API and document that instead.

:computer: [Pigeon Protocol API](https://samples.alexakreizinger.com/api/pigeon-protocol)
: An API reference for the fictitious Pigeon Protocol service.

## Content marketing
Not your typical tech writer fare, but I reported to Marketing at one point and wrote enough marketing-led docs to warrant including these here. (Like the [user guides](#user-guides), they're all real samples—minus any identifying details.)

:books: [User Risk Factors](https://samples.alexakreizinger.com/blog/risk-factors/)
: A short blog post that explains some of the most common user risk factors flagged by CompanyName’s fraud detection algorithm.

:books: [In Ecommerce, Trust is Key](https://samples.alexakreizinger.com/blog/trust-report/)
: A statistics-driven report about ecommerce consumer trust.

:books: [Best Practices For Order Rules](https://samples.alexakreizinger.com/blog/order-rules/)
: A short blog post that helps users get the most out of ProductName's Order Rules feature.

## Miscellaneous
Other docs-related goodies.

:floppy_disk: [AK's Style Guide Template](https://alexakreizinger.github.io/styleguidetemplate/)
: A Jekyll-based framework for building style guides that use single-sourced rulesets across multiple audiences.
